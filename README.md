Astar-Maze-Solver
=================
In this project, I randomely generated a maze and a graph using a disjoint set and then solved them using the A* star algorithm.  I used the Manhattan heuristic. To keep track of the vertexes and edges of the graph, I chose to use an adjacency list.  The Graph Visualizer and Maze Visualizer contain Java Swing GUI's so that you can see the algorithms at work.
